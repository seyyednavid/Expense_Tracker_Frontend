# Getting Started with Create React App
I created an expense tracking application using React (for the frontend), Node.js and Express (for the backend), 
and MongoDB (for the database). This app allows users to effectively manage and monitor their personal expenses.

# Goals:
The primary objective of developing this expense tracking application was to gain hands-on experience in creating a full-stack web application. This project aimed to provide practical insights into the process of building and deploying various components, including the frontend with React, the backend with Node.js and Express, and the database with MongoDB. Additionally, it aimed to offer users an efficient tool for managing and tracking their personal expenses.
